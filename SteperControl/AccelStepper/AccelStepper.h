// AccelStepper.h
//
/// \mainpage AccelStepper library for Arduino
///
/// This is the Arduino AccelStepper library.
/// It provides an object-oriented interface for 2, 3 or 4 pin stepper motors.
///
/// The standard Arduino IDE includes the Stepper library
/// (http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Stepper) for stepper motors. It is
/// perfectly adequate for simple, single motor applications.
///
/// AccelStepper significantly improves on the standard Arduino Stepper library in several ways:
/// \li Supports acceleration and deceleration
/// \li Supports multiple simultaneous steppers, with independent concurrent stepping on each stepper
/// \li API functions never delay() or block
/// \li Supports 2, 3 and 4 wire steppers, plus 3 and 4 wire half steppers.
/// \li Supports alternate stepping functions to enable support of AFMotor (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library)
/// \li Supports stepper drivers such as the Sparkfun EasyDriver (based on 3967 driver chip)
/// \li Very slow speeds are supported
/// \li Extensive API
/// \li Subclass support
///

/// Tested on Arduino Diecimila and Mega with arduino-0018 & arduino-0021 
/// on OpenSuSE 11.1 and avr-libc-1.6.1-1.15,
/// cross-avr-binutils-2.19-9.1, cross-avr-gcc-4.1.3_20080612-26.5.

/// \par Installation
///
/// Install in the usual way: unzip the distribution zip file to the libraries
/// sub-folder of your sketchbook. 
///
/// \par Theory
///
/// This code uses speed calculations as described in 
/// "Generate stepper-motor speed profiles in real time" by David Austin 
/// http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf
/// with the exception that AccelStepper uses steps per second rather than radians per second
/// (because we dont know the step angle of the motor)
/// An initial step interval is calculated for the first step, based on the desired acceleration
/// On subsequent steps, shorter step intervals are calculated based 
/// on the previous step until max speed is achieved.

/// \par Revision History
/// \version 1.0 Initial release
///
/// \version 1.1 Added speed() function to get the current speed.
/// \version 1.2 Added runSpeedToPosition() submitted by Gunnar Arndt.
/// \version 1.3 Added support for stepper drivers (ie with Step and Direction inputs) with _pins == 1
/// \version 1.4 Added functional contructor to support AFMotor, contributed by Limor, with example sketches.
/// \version 1.5 Improvements contributed by Peter Mousley: Use of microsecond steps and other speed improvements
///              to increase max stepping speed to about 4kHz. New option for user to set the min allowed pulse width.
///              Added checks for already running at max speed and skip further calcs if so. 
/// \version 1.6 Fixed a problem with wrapping of microsecond stepping that could cause stepping to hang. 
///              Reported by Sandy Noble.
///              Removed redundant _lastRunTime member.
/// \version 1.7 Fixed a bug where setCurrentPosition() did not always work as expected. 
///              Reported by Peter Linhart.
/// \version 1.8 Added support for 4 pin half-steppers, requested by Harvey Moon
/// \version 1.9 setCurrentPosition() now also sets motor speed to 0.
/// \version 1.10 Builds on Arduino 1.0
/// \version 1.11 Improvments from Michael Ellison:
///   Added optional enable line support for stepper drivers
///   Added inversion for step/direction/enable lines for stepper drivers
/// \version 1.12 Announce Google Group
/// \version 1.13 Improvements to speed calculation. Cost of calculation is now less in the worst case, 
///    and more or less constant in all cases. This should result in slightly beter high speed performance, and
///    reduce anomalous speed glitches when other steppers are accelerating. 
///    However, its hard to see how to replace the sqrt() required at the very first step from 0 speed.
/// \version 1.14 Fixed a problem with compiling under arduino 0021 reported by EmbeddedMan
/// \version 1.15 Fixed a problem with runSpeedToPosition which did not correctly handle
///    running backwards to a smaller target position. Added examples
/// \version 1.16 Fixed some cases in the code where abs() was used instead of fabs().
/// \version 1.17 Added example ProportionalControl
/// \version 1.18 Fixed a problem: If one calls the funcion runSpeed() when Speed is zero, it makes steps 
///    without counting. reported by  Friedrich, Klappenbach.
/// \version 1.19 Added MotorInterfaceType and symbolic names for the number of pins to use
///               for the motor interface. Updated examples to suit.
///               Replaced individual pin assignment variables _pin1, _pin2 etc with array _pin[4].
///               _pins member changed to _interface.
///               Added _pinInverted array to simplify pin inversion operations.
///               Added new function setOutputPins() which sets the motor output pins.
///               It can be overridden in order to provide, say, serial output instead of parallel output
///               Some refactoring and code size reduction.
/// \version 1.20 Improved documentation and examples to show need for correctly
///               specifying AccelStepper::FULL4WIRE and friends.
/// \version 1.21 Fixed a problem where desiredSpeed could compute the wrong step acceleration
///               when _speed was small but non-zero. Reported by Brian Schmalz.
///               Precompute sqrt_twoa to improve performance and max possible stepping speed
/// \version 1.22 Added Bounce.pde example
///               Fixed a problem where calling moveTo(), setMaxSpeed(), setAcceleration() more 
///               frequently than the step time, even
///               with the same values, would interfere with speed calcs. Now a new speed is computed 
///               only if there was a change in the set value. Reported by Brian Schmalz.
/// \version 1.23 Rewrite of the speed algorithms in line with 
///               http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf
///               Now expect smoother and more linear accelerations and decelerations. The desiredSpeed()
///               function was removed.
/// \version 1.24  Fixed a problem introduced in 1.23: with runToPosition, which did never returned
/// \version 1.25  Now ignore attempts to set acceleration to 0.0
/// \version 1.26  Fixed a problem where certina combinations of speed and accelration could cause
///                oscillation about the target position.
/// \version 1.27  Added stop() function to stop as fast as possible with current acceleration parameters.
///                Also added new Quickstop example showing its use.
/// \version 1.28  Fixed another problem where certain combinations of speed and accelration could cause
///                oscillation about the target position.
///                Added support for 3 wire full and half steppers such as Hard Disk Drive spindle.
///                Contributed by Yuri Ivatchkovitch.
/// \version 1.29  Fixed a problem that could cause a DRIVER stepper to continually step
///                with some sketches. Reported by Vadim.
/// \version 1.30  Fixed a problem that could cause stepper to back up a few steps at the end of
///                accelerated travel with certain speeds. Reported and patched by jolo.
/// \version 1.31  Updated author and distribution location details to airspayce.com
/// \version 1.32  Fixed a problem with enableOutputs() and setEnablePin on Arduino Due that
///                prevented the enable pin changing stae correctly. Reported by Duane Bishop.
/// \version 1.33  Fixed an error in example AFMotor_ConstantSpeed.pde did not setMaxSpeed();
///                Fixed a problem that caused incorrect pin sequencing of FULL3WIRE and HALF3WIRE.
///                Unfortunately this meant changing the signature for all step*() functions.
///                Added example MotorShield, showing how to use AdaFruit Motor Shield to control
///                a 3 phase motor such as a HDD spindle motor (and without using the AFMotor library.
/// \version 1.34  Added setPinsInverted(bool pin1Invert, bool pin2Invert, bool pin3Invert, bool pin4Invert, bool enableInvert) 
///                to allow inversion of 2, 3 and 4 wire stepper pins. Requested by Oleg.
/// \version 1.35  Removed default args from setPinsInverted(bool, bool, bool, bool, bool) to prevent ambiguity with 
///                setPinsInverted(bool, bool, bool). Reported by Mac Mac.
/// \version 1.36  Changed enableOutputs() and disableOutputs() to be virtual so can be overridden.
///                Added new optional argument 'enable' to constructor, which allows you toi disable the

/// \version 1.37  Fixed a problem with step1 that could cause a rogue step in the 
///                wrong direction (or not,

///                Reported by Mark Tillotson.
